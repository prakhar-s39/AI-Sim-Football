# AI-Sim-Football
In this repo, we present a lightweight and customizable 2D football simulation framework built using Pygame to investigate multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) in adversarial environments. Leveraging the Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (MAPPO) algorithm under a centralized training and decentralized execution (CTDE) paradigm, we train cooperative agents to perform coordinated behaviors such as passing, positioning, and goal scoring in competitive 1v1/ 5v5/ 11v11 scenarios. The environment is designed for fast prototyping and includes configurable physics, reward shaping, and player dynamics. We introduce a potential-based reward shaping scheme that balances sparse terminal rewards with dense intermediate feedback to encourage teamwork and strategic play. Experimental results demonstrate the emergence of complex behaviors such as ball possession maintenance and spatial coverage without explicit supervision. This platform provides a testbed for studying coordination, reward design, and adversarial multi-agent dynamics in simplified football simulations.
